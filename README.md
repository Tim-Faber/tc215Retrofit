# Brother TC215 Retrofit
Retrofit of a Brother TC215 machining center with linuxcnc/machinekit (not yet sure which one will be used in the end).

## Hardware
* Brother TC215, build in 1990
* Mesa 7i77 
* Mesa 6i25 (will be replaced by 7i80HD)
* Celeron J1800 based board (Asus) (will be replaced by a Thinkpad X230t with touchscreen)

## Wiring
So far, the original wiring is kept and the Mesa hardware is connected to the relay board via CNIOS and CNIOM (pinout provided).

## Configuration
will be pushed as soon as it's usable
